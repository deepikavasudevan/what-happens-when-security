# What can go wrong ...

This is inspired by the [what-happens-when](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) that details what happens when you type google.com and press enter. In this version, we attempt to answer "**What can go wrong security-wise when you you are on a login page, you enter your username and password, and press enter.**" Where possible, the headings match the original `what-happens-when`

This is a collaborative process so don't be afraid to help out! There are tons of details missing, just waiting for you to add them! So please send a pull request if you'd like.
